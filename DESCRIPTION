Description: An R package for creating an R/tidyverse project skeleton that is closely, but not entirely, compliant-ish with the psych-DS standard, and check whether a given project is compliant-ish with psych-DS. Hence, psych-DS(ish). The layout is loosely inspired by the [psych-DS](https://psych-ds.github.io/) specification, but is not fully psych-DS compliant. It adds extra conventions for reproducibility and common tidyverse workflows, including Quarto file templates and a .gitignore file. It does not comply with psych-ds's .json requirement.
